# Equalization Room

Get two things from the INBOX. If they are EQUAL, put ONE of them in the OUTBOX. Discard non-equal pairs. Repeat! 

As a note, if you have not already used them; comments are a great tool to mark sections of 
your program. 

```js
// This is a line comment 

/**
 *  This is a block comment 
 */
```

Line comments are used to comment out a single line while a block comment 
comments out multiple lines. 

It has been recommended to combine the `map` and `filter` function to transform the value and
to use the `filter` method to remove any `undefined` elements. 

-  The best way to tell if two items are equal, use the `==` equals operator
