# Exclusive Lounge 

For each TWO things in the INBOX:

Send a `0` to the OUTBOX if they have the same sign. (Both positive or both negative.)
Send a `1` to the OUTBOX if their signs are different. Repeat until the `INBOX` is empty.

Challenge Note: A value of `0` and `1` have been added to the floor. `0` at index `4`. `1` at index `5`. 

Concept note: This challenge is named after the `XOR` also known as `exclusive OR` where a `0` is returned
if two values are the same and `1` is returned if the two values are different.
