# Zero Exterminator 

Send all things that ARE NOT ZERO to the OUTBOX. 

In order to do so, you will need to use the `filter` method on the `inbox` array 
and check to see if each element in the array does not equal zero. 


```js
const words = ['spray', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];
const result = words.filter((word) => word.length > 6);
``` 

This is the syntax of how to use the `filter` method. Good luck.
