# Mail Room 

Three items will be passed into the `inbox` array and must be sent 
to the `outbox` in the same order. 

For authenticity to the game, the only things inside the function able to be manipulated
are the inbox and the outbox. The way to solve this problem is to move each item from the 
`inbox` to the `outbox` array using indexes. 

Fun Fact: Array indexes are kinda like British building floors where the ground floor is the first
floor in a building and array indexes start at 0.

So the ground floor and array index 0 would both technically be the first item.
