# Busy Mail Room 

Twenty-five items will be passed into the `inbox` array and must be sent 
to the `outbox` in the same order. 

It is advised to use a `for` loop to iterate through the items from the `inbox`, as 
a `for` loop will let you repeat the same lines in your code a fixed number of times. 

Fun Fact: Despite the lack of a `jump` keyword (which allows the program to jump to 
different lines), it is still roughly three lines of code to complete the challenge.
