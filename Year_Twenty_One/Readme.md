# Zero Terminated Sum

The INBOX is filled with zero terminated strings! 

Add together all the numbers in each string. When you reach the end of a string (marked by a ZERO), put your sum in the OUTBOX. Reset and repeat for each string.

-  About zero-terminated strings, they are very old. They are the most common way for a program to signify the end of a line of text, and this is done so that programmers don't need to know exactly how long each line of text is. They simply print out the lines one character at a time until they reach the zero, signifying that the text is finished. 

- Fun fact: This strategy can be seen today in RPG Maker MV data files. 

- Each number in the inbox is represented by a string and will only contain one number
