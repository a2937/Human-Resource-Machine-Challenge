# Countdown 

For each number in the INBOX, send that number to the OUTBOX, followed by all numbers down to (or up to) zero. It's a countdown!


It is recommended to use the `increment` and `decrement` operator for this challenge. They add one or subtract one
from the variable and give the result back to you.
