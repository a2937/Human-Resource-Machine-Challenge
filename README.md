# Human-Resource-Machine-Challenge
A recreation of the code challenges featured in the hit video game Human Resource Machine by Tomorrow Corporation.  

Every code challenge has a function called `humanResourceMachine` that takes as input
an array filled with numbers and letters. 

The `inbox` is represented as the input parameter and the `outbox` is designed 
as an array inside the function that gets returned. 

Each challenge will be labelled by the year in game it represents; and be given a starter code 
and a solution to compare it to. The goal is to have it represented in multiple languages.
