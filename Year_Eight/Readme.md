# Tripler Room

For each thing in the INBOX, TRIPLE it. And OUTBOX the result. 

In order to do so, you will need to use the `map` method on the `inbox` array 
and multiply each value by 3. It accepts a callback just like the `filter` method. 

```js
const numbers = [1, 4, 9];
const roots = numbers.map((num) => Math.sqrt(num));
``` 

This is the syntax of how to use the `map` method. Good luck.  


- Note: To multiply use the multiplication operator `*`
